# FPAWIP Grid

## Future Proof Always Work In Progress Grid

This repository contains the grid I’ve developed until now.
I’m still developing the grid and I add new features and fixes every project I develop with this grid.

You can use it, it’s solid and production ready, and if you run in any problem let me know opening an issue.
I’ll do my best to help.

### Technicalities

The grid is built with a Flexbox-first, desktop-first, approach and then with a inline-block fallback for non-modern browsers.
Tested on modern browsers and IE8+. Everything worked fine so far since 2012.

### Dependencies

This grid has no dependencies.
It optionally uses the ZeroSpace Font to remove white spaces between inline-block elements, see https://github.com/marcolago/ZeroSpace-Font for more info.

### Use 

No instructions here for now, sorry.
I will write down instructions and some examples one day.

Note that this grid is desktop-first but this does not limit you to think mobile-first while you design.
I simply think that desktop-first in layout development still is the best approach (IMHO).
